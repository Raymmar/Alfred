Goal:
Create a self-contained local-first app inspired by Loom.com with user account support, local recording, transcription, and custom processing using user-supplied AI tokens.

Core Features:

Media Access and Recording

Allow users to select and configure local devices: cameras, microphones, and screen sharing.
Store user preferences for future sessions (e.g., preferred devices).
Add a "Start Recording" button to initiate recording of:
Selected video input (camera feed).
Audio input (microphone feed).
Screen sharing (specific screen/window).
Save recordings locally in a structured format (e.g., MP4/WEBM for video, WAV/MP3 for audio).
Transcription and AI Processing

Once recording is complete:
Transcribe the audio using an AI transcription tool (e.g., Whisper or another local-first transcription library).
Process the transcription against a custom prompt defined by the user in a settings panel.
Allow users to upload and configure their own API keys for LLMs like OpenAI GPT, Claude, etc., via a secure token manager.
User Accounts and Project Management

Implement basic user accounts (local authentication).
Users should be able to log in and view prior recordings (projects).
Store all project data (recordings, transcriptions, preferences) locally on the userâ€™s device.
Folder structure example: /MyAppData/{username}/{project_name}.
Settings Panel

Allow users to:
Choose their preferred AI transcription tool.
Set a custom processing prompt.
Input and manage API tokens securely.
UI/UX Considerations

Simple, intuitive interface:
Start/Stop recording button.
List view of previous projects.
Settings panel for user preferences and AI integration.
Tech Stack Recommendations:

Frontend: React (or simple web UI via HTML/CSS/JS)
Media Access: MediaDevices API for video/audio/screen access.
Transcription:
Local-first: Whisper (optional local deployment).
Cloud-based (fallback): OpenAI Whisper API.
Local Storage:
IndexedDB or local file system for projects, preferences, and recordings.
LLM Integration: User-configurable API tokens for OpenAI, Claude, etc.
User Authentication: Simple local storage authentication (e.g., username/password stored locally).
Project Phases:

Set up local media device access and recording functionality.
Implement local storage for recordings and settings.
Add transcription functionality.
Add LLM integration for processing transcription outputs.
Build user authentication and project management interface.
